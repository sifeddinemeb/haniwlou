# Development Roadmap

## ðŸ›  PHASE 1: FIX (Critical Issues - Week 1-2)

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Supabase Integration** (#backend-critical)
   - Set up authentication tables and RLS policies
   - Create reports database schema
   - Implement file storage for media uploads
   - Connect forms to actual data persistence

2. **Core Functionality** (#core-fixes)
   - Fix report submission to save data
   - Implement real authentication flow
   - Add proper form validation and error handling
   - Fix emergency call button implementation

3. **Critical UX Bugs** (#ux-critical)
   - Add loading states to all forms
   - Implement error boundaries and toast notifications
   - Fix mobile navigation menu behavior
   - Add empty states for all list views

### Security Essentials
- Input sanitization for all forms
- File upload validation (type, size, content)
- Rate limiting on form submissions
- Remove sensitive data from mock files

## ðŸ§¹ PHASE 2: IMPROVE (Code Quality - Week 3-4)

### Component Refactoring (#refactoring)
**Priority**: High-impact files that are too large
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` â†’ Split into smaller components
- `src/pages/ViewAllReports.tsx` â†’ Extract filter and pagination logic
- `src/pages/ReportDetail.tsx` â†’ Separate media gallery component
- `src/pages/Report.tsx` â†’ Create step components

### Code Organization
- Create shared hooks for common logic (useReports, useAuth)
- Extract utility functions to separate files
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Implement consistent loading states

### Testing Infrastructure
- Set up unit testing with Vitest
- Add integration tests for critical flows
- Implement E2E testing for report submission
- Create component testing for UI interactions

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Add React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies

## ðŸš€ PHASE 3: SCALE (Advanced Features - Week 5-8)

### Advanced Functionality
1. **Real-time Features** (#realtime)
   - Live report updates with Supabase subscriptions
   - Real-time like counts and status changes
   - Push notifications for nearby incidents
   - Live map updates with new reports

2. **Admin Dashboard** (#admin)
   - Moderation interface for reports
   - Bulk status updates
   - User management and roles
   - Analytics and reporting tools

3. **Enhanced UX** (#advanced-ux)
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
   - Offline support for reading reports
   - Advanced search with full-text search
   - Dark mode support

4. **Geolocation Integration** (#geo)
   - GPS location detection
   - Address autocomplete
   - Distance-based filtering
   - Geofencing for local alerts

### Infrastructure Scaling
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
- Set up staging and production environments
- Add monitoring and error tracking
- Optimize database queries and indexing

### Internationalization
- Full Arabic localization
- French language support
- English fallback
- Currency and date formatting

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier compliance
- **Test Coverage**: >80% test coverage
- **Performance**: <3s initial load time
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance

### User Experience Metrics
- **Form Completion**: >90% multi-step form completion
- **Mobile Usage**: Responsive design works on all devices
- **Error Rates**: <1% form submission errors
- **Loading Performance**: All actions complete in <2s

### Feature Completeness
- **Authentication**: Full signup/login flow
- **Reporting**: End-to-end report submission and viewing
- **Moderation**: Admin can manage report status
- **Real-time**: Live updates for all data changes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Supabase Limitations**: Have backup plan for scaling
- **Arabic RTL**: Test thoroughly across browsers
- **File Storage**: Implement size limits and CDN
- **Real-time Scale**: Plan for connection limits

### Business Risks
- **Content Moderation**: Need clear policies and tools
- **User Safety**: Ensure anonymity protection
- **Legal Compliance**: Align with Algerian data laws
- **Community Trust**: Transparent content policies

## Resource Requirements
- **1 Senior React Developer**: Lead development and architecture
- **1 Backend Developer**: Supabase integration and optimization
- **1 UI/UX Designer**: Arabic design and mobile optimization
- **1 QA Engineer**: Testing and quality assurance
