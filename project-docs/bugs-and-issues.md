# Bugs and Issues

## ðŸ”´ Critical Bugs

### Navigation Issues (#navigation-bugs)
**File**: `src/components/Header.tsx`
- **Issue**: Emergency call buttons use `window.location.href = tel:` which may not work on all devices
- **Impact**: Emergency functionality unreliable
- **Fix**: Use proper phone link handling with fallback UI

### Form State Management âœ… FULLY RESOLVED (#form-bugs)
**File**: `src/pages/Report.tsx` 
- **Issue**: Multi-step form doesn't persist data when user navigates away
- **Status**: FULLY RESOLVED - Implemented comprehensive form state management
- **Fix**: Added localStorage-based draft saving, step-by-step validation, real database integration, and media upload

### Mock Data Inconsistency âœ… RESOLVED (#data-bugs)
**File**: Database Integration
- **Issue**: Was using mock data instead of real database
- **Status**: RESOLVED - All forms now connect to Supabase database
- **Fix**: Implemented real data persistence with proper validation

## ðŸŸ¡ UX Issues

### Loading States âœ… FULLY RESOLVED (#loading-ux)
**Files**: Dashboard, Authentication, Report components, and FileUpload
- **Issue**: No loading states for report submission, likes, or navigation
- **Status**: FULLY RESOLVED - Added comprehensive loading states throughout the app
- **Completed**: Report form submission, file upload progress, geolocation loading, dashboard data loading, skeleton loading for cards

### Error Handling âœ… IMPROVED (#error-handling)
**Files**: Authentication and Report components
- **Issue**: No error boundaries or user-friendly error messages
- **Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Added comprehensive error handling to auth and report forms
- **Remaining**: Need error boundaries for other components

### Mobile Navigation (#mobile-nav)
**File**: `src/components/Header.tsx` (Lines 25-35)
- **Issue**: Mobile menu doesn't close after navigation
- **Impact**: Poor mobile UX
- **Fix**: Add menu close handler on route change

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues

### Accessibility (#a11y-gaps)
- Missing alt text on some images
- No keyboard navigation for map interactions
- Color contrast issues in some text areas

### Performance (#perf-minor)
- Large mock data file loaded on every page
- No image optimization or lazy loading
- Unnecessary re-renders in map component

### Code Quality (#code-quality)
**Files**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/pages/ViewAllReports.tsx`, `src/pages/ReportDetail.tsx`
- **Issue**: Files exceed 300+ lines and should be refactored
- **Impact**: Hard to maintain and debug
- **Fix**: Split into smaller, focused components

## Browser Compatibility
- **Tested**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop)
- **Not Tested**: IE11, older mobile browsers
- **Known Issues**: RTL layout quirks in older browsers

## Security Considerations
- No input sanitization implemented
- File upload has no type/size validation
- No rate limiting on form submissions
- Mock data exposes potentially sensitive information patterns
